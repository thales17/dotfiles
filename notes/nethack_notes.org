- You can also press =?= to see the help menu

* Goal of the game
- Find the amulet of yendor and exit the dungeon
- When you first load into the game there is a staircase leaving the dungeon
- If you go up that staircase without the amulet you will forfeit the game

* Staircases
- The =<= means a staircase going up
- The =>= means a staircase going down
- Use the greater than or less than symbols to go up or down a staircase
- Pets will only follow you down the staircase if they are adjacent to the player

* Pets
- You will be granted a pet at the start of each game
- Pets can level up, with each enemy they kill

* Game state
- Each time you move, the world moves as well
- This typically only applies to the floor you are on
- So if you are on floor 2 enemies on floor 1 do not move when you interactive with floor 2

* Level generation
- When you enter a level (or floor) it is generated, the level did not exist until you entered the floor
- When a floor is generated this also generates the enemies
- The strength of enemies is based on the floor as well as the player strength
- It might advantageous to generate levels as soon as possible to minimize the enemy strength scale
- You cannot clear out all the enemies on a level
- They will continue to spawn
- When they spawn they will take the player level into account

* Looking around (Far look)
- Press the =;= key to move the cursor around
- Highlight something and press =,= to see information about it
- Alternatively you can press =/= to bring up the look menu
- If you press =/= again from the look menu you can continue to look at things without exiting look mode after pressing =,=

* Inventory
- Press the =i= key to open your inventory
- When over an object you want to pick up press the =,= key
- Each item in your inventory gets a letter assigned to it
- You can view that letter here (also when you are doing the command they will sometimes let you peak at your inventory with =?=

- You will eventually get hungry and need to eat
- You can sometimes get nourishment from corpses you have killed
- Some enemies are poisonous (Kobolds) so be careful eating just any old corpse
- Food rations provide the most amount of nourishment
- Eating food does not restore HP, instead it nourshes you

* Identifying
- You need to identify items to know if they are cursed or not

* Passing time
- If you want to advance the turn without moving press the =.= key
- This is sometimes handy when you want to wait for a pet to be in an adjacent location before ascending or descending a staircase

* Searching
- Sometimes there are hidden items around you
- Press the =s= key to search around
- This will advance the turn similar to =.= but it will also search
- You might find a hidden door

* Armor Class
- In the HUD you will see the Armor Class abbreviated as AC: <SOME_VALUE>

* Encumbrance (Burdened)
- You can pick up too many things and become encumbered
- Encumbered state makes it harder to move
- You will gain a status effect "Burdened" when you have too much stuff

* Praying
- As a last ditch effort you can use the extended menu (=#=) to =pray=
- This could turn the tide in your favor
- Your role (job) and alignment determine which deity you pray to
- You should not depend on praying, you can anger your Deity

* Bone Files
- When you die on a level, the game will persist this information in a bones file on the host computer
- The game could then use this file to expose cursed items or the player corpse in a future run
- If you play on a shared server there could be a lot of bones files from many previous runs by other players

* Directions
- Sometimes you are prompted for a direction
- Press the =.= to indicate the tile underfoot

- The shop keeper will block the exit of the door until you have paid for all the items that you have picked up
- You can drop things in the store to sell them
- Selling unidentified items and seeing how much the shop keeper offers for it is a good way to deduce the value of a unidentified item
- The shopkeeper might not be interested in the items you drop

* Altars
- Any item that you don't know if it is cursed or not you can drop on an altar and it will reveal its cursed state
- If you pray near an altar something good might happen, especially if the altar matches your alignment
- If you use multidrop =D= you can select items pf umknown B/C/U status
