* What is?
** What is Plain Text Accounting?
- https://plaintextaccounting.org/
- Using software the uses plain text files for accounting records
- The primary benefit of plain text format is to ensure that account data is accessible and freely integrated with new software
** What is Ledger?
- https://www.ledger-cli.org/
- A cli tool to parse plain text double entry accounting files
- The ledger tool uses the UNIX design philosophy, so it provides no interface outside of the command line
- Its primary purpose is to generate reports from ledger files
- Ledger uses double-entry style bookkeeping
- Ledger is written in C++ and is actively maintained
- Created in 2003 and inspired a lot of =ledger-likes=, including =hledger= and =beancount=
** What is double-entry bookkeeping?
- This tracks transactions as an in (credits) and an out (debits)
- The balance of all of your accounts should total to zero
** What is =hledger=?
- https://hledger.org/
- hledger is written in Haskell and is actively maintained
- It also has an active community producing videos on YouTube, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZLxXTjOqLzq4z5Jy0AyWSQ/videos][hledger fan]]
- Provides small tools to manipulate the ledger files from the command line
** What is =beancount=?
- https://beancount.github.io/
- beancount is written in Python and is actively maintained

* Ledger Format
** Transaction
- A transaction starts with the date of the transaction, followed by a name
- Below the transaction line you need to indicate which account was credited and which was debited
- You can list as many accounts as necessary indicating which had a credit and which had a debit
- For debits you can prefix the amount with a negative symbol
- If you only show a credit the second account will automatically be debited the amount of the credit

** Accounts
- Accounts can have any format but it is common to organize them into categories
- Categories can have sub-categories typically delimitted with a ':'
- Ledger docs recommend 5 high level categories:
  - *Expenses*: where money goes
  - *Assets*: where money sits
  - *Income*: where money comes from
  - *Liabilities*: money you owe
  - *Equity*: the real value of your property
** Comment Characters
- ';' is the default comment character for ledger files.
- Additionally '#', '|', '*' and '%' are comment characters
