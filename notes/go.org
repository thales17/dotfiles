* Setup
** GOPATH
- The default value for the =$GOPATH= environment variable is =$HOME/go=
- Tools that are installed will be in =$GOPATH/bin= folder
- It might be advantageous to add =$GOPATH/bin= to your =$PATH= environment variable

** Installing Beta Versions of Go
- If you have go installed you can install a beta version using the =go= tool
- For example: =go install golang.org/dl/go1.18beta2@latest=
- This will now make the beta available on your system as =go1.18beta2=. Use this as you would the =go= tool
