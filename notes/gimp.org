* Hotkeys
- =/= - Allows you to search for any command in the menus
- =M= - for the move tool
- =Shift + C= - Crop Tool
- =Shift + S= - Scale Tool
- =Shift + T= - Transform Tool
- =Ctrl + Alt + O= - Open as Layer

* Adding a outline around text
- First add your text in the desired foreground color
- With the text layer selected, in the Layers list right click the text layer and select =Alpha to Selection=
- Use the =/= command and type =Grow=
- Input the border pixel size you would like around the text
- Create a new layer below the text layer
- Select the border color you would like
- With the "grown" text still selected on the new layer use the bucket fill tool to add the border
- The last step is right click the original text layer and merge down into the border layer

* Inserting an Image
- Add the image as a new layer with =File/Open As Layer=
- The image will be added at its natural size which could be way bigger than the canvas
- If you need to resize it use the scale tool
- You might need to scale a bit then move the new image and scale again, since it might get positioned off the edge of the canvas
