* Linking to info pages
- The info function passed with the file or node will load the info section
#+begin_src elisp
  (info "elisp")
#+end_src
- When you want to go to a specifc node a info file place the file name in parenthesis
#+begin_src elisp
  (info "(elisp) Simple Macro")
#+end_src
- The path to a particular node can be seen in the mode line in the info buffer

* Keyboard Macros
- Execute this lisp function to load the info page on keyboard macros (info "(emacs) Keyboard Macros")
- To start recording a keyboard macro use =C-x (= or =<F3>=
- Once recording has started you will see =Def= in the mode line
- If you press =C-g= you will cancel recording the keyboard macro
- Once you have finished typing the macro commands press =C-x )= or =<F4>=
- To repeat the macro continue pressing =<F4>=
- Use the function =name-last-kbd-macro= to give a name to the macro at the top of the ring
- Once named you can invoke a keyboard macro like any other interactive function with =M-x <NAME_OF_MACRO>=
- If you want to see the lisp behind the macro you can run =M-x insert-kbd-macro=

* Recursively search for a file by name
Use =M-x find-name-dired= it will prompt you for a folder to recursively search then it prompt you for the file name.

* Recurively search file files with given content
Use =M-x rgrep= it wil prompt for the thing you are looking for in the files, followed by the wildcard of the files to include(ivy will do a completing read for this and prepend the current path but just type the wild card pretending it is not there) and lastly the base directory.
