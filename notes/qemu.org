- *User Mode Emulation* - emulates a CPU only, useful when wanting to run a binary compiled for another CPU. The binary must be a linux binary however

* libvirt
- libvirt is an API to manage virtual machines
- The primary driver for libvirt in linux is the KVM/QEMU driver
- Many GUI clients have been written to use the libvirt API
- virt-manager is a popular client made by Redhat
